### The study
Infectieradar.be processes personal data in a lawful manner, in accordance with the law and the GDPR regulations. You can read more about this in the [Informed Consent Form](https://infectieradar.be/en/project/). This study has obtained ethical approval from the UZA Ethics Committee and the University of Hasselt Medical Ethics Committee. 

In this privacy policy, which supplements the general privacy policy, you can read about how data are processed by Infectieradar.be. By sharing your data with Infectieradar.be, you are contributing to research into the spread of infectious diseases and the new coronavirus in particular. If you want to participate in this study, you will be invited every week to complete a questionnaire to provide information about recent symptoms you have experienced (such as a fever or coughing) that may indicate an infection. This platform has been set up in collaboration with Influenzanet. Influenzanet is the name of a partnership between a number of European universities and governments. An overview of its participants can be found [here](https://infectieradar.be/influenzanet/). Infectieradar.be is the Belgian application of this research study.

Participation in the study is voluntary. We wish to stress that the questionnaires and the use of the website serve **no** medical purpose for you. If you have any concerns about your health, you should always seek help from the usual medical bodies.

### The study in short

---

#### 1.  What data are collected and processed during the study? 
    
The personal data that are collected and processed are data about your health and medical condition, including your medical history, some background information (e.g. your age, gender, etc.) and information about medical care you have sought.

#### 2.  How will the researcher treat my personal data?
    
The researchers who analyse your data will only have access to non-identifiable data. The data will be encrypted or coded by the following method:

The database administrator will never disclose your identity (email address), and he/she will encrypt your data (i.e. replace your identity in the study with an identification code) before the researchers analyse your data. Your identity will therefore not be used in a scientific publication or presentation. 

This means that the database administrator, under the responsibility of the study leaders, will be the only person able to link your identity to the data communicated during the study, with the exceptions mentioned in section 6.

The data that the researchers analyse will not allow them to identify you.

#### 3. What will happen to the information about me that is collected during the study?
    
Your participation in the study means that your personal data

-   will be collected, and

-   will be used in encrypted form by the researchers.
    
The researcher and the sponsor may only use the encrypted personal data for the specific research purposes described earlier.

In addition, the sponsor may grant external researchers (who are not involved in this study) access to the encrypted data. If an external researcher wishes to use the data in research not yet described in this document, this research must be approved by an Ethics Committee.

#### 4. How will my data be processed?
  
Your study data will be processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <sup>[1]</sup> and the Belgian data protection law of 30 July 2018 <sup>[2]</sup>. The sponsor is the controller with responsibility for this.

The grounds on which we are allowed to process your personal data are that we are conducting scientific research and that you have given your consent.

<small>[1] Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.</small> 

<small>[2] The Belgian law of 30 July 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.</small>

#### 5. Can I access and correct my data that have been collected and processed during the study?
   
You have the right to ask the researchers what data about you have been collected and what they are used for in this study.

You have the right to

-   access and check these data

-   have all your data deleted

-   request correction if they are incorrect

-   restrict the processing of your data

-   oppose the processing of your personal data

-   withdraw your consent to the processing of personal data. Your personal data that have already been collected before your withdrawal of consent will be kept to prevent any misinterpretation of the study results.

#### 6. Apart from the researcher and the researcher’s personnel, who else has access to my personal data? 
    
In order to check the quality of the study, your non-encrypted personal data or information relevant to this study may be inspected by people other than the study personnel. Any such inspection will take place under the researcher’s supervision, and the people concerned will be bound by professional secrecy or by a confidentiality agreement. They may include:

-   personnel designated by the sponsor (monitors and auditors) and people or organisations providing services to or collaborating with the sponsor. However, they will never pass on your name and contact details to the sponsor.
    
-   inspectors from competent health authorities from around the world

-   an independent audit group

-   persons designated by the Ethics Committee.
    
If required for the study, the encrypted study data may be sent to other countries within and outside the European Union (EU) and verified by:

-   personnel (other than inspectors) of the competent health authorities of Belgium (the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products, FAMHP) or other countries within and outside the EU,

-   the Belgian evaluating Ethics Committee(s),

-   external researchers,

-   the study’s sponsor, personnel designated by the sponsor and people or organisations providing services to or collaborating with the sponsor, and/or

- companies from the sponsor's group in Belgium and in other countries within and outside the EU.
    
European regulations and Belgian data protection legislation impose restrictions on the transfer of data to non-EU countries. The sponsor must always ensure that your encrypted study data are equally protected when transferred to a non-EU country. If the sponsor concludes a data protection agreement for this purpose, a copy of this agreement may be obtained from the researcher.

#### 7. What will happen to the results of the study?
    
After its completion, a description and the results of the study will be published in specialist medical journals. A copy of the scientific publication will be published on the website and will be available from the researcher or study personnel.

These websites or publications will not contain any information by which you can be identified.

#### 8. Will my data be used for purposes other than the study in which I am participating?
    
The results of the study will only be used to answer the scientific questions in this study. Any additional or future research outside the study must always be approved by a recognised Belgian Ethics Committee.

#### 9. For how long will my data be kept?
    
After the study, your encrypted data will be kept for at least 25 years to ensure the validity of the study. This will be the case even if you withdraw from the study before its completion.
